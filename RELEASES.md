# Releases

TODO

## TODO

- We should use GitHub Milestones better so that we add all issues/PRs that have been closed and will be included in the next release. As part of that, we can use the due date to show our intended release date
- We should always create a GitHub Discussion linked to our release so that people get notified and can join the discussion (release also gives notification but no discussion)
- We need to come up with a reasonable window for our cycle, for example ship every 2mo
- We use semantic versioning
- We provide a changelog with all changes per version and include them in releases as well
- We need to define a procedure to deprecate features
- We will always provide a migration guide for new major versions ([example](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/migration/))
