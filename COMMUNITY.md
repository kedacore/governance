# Community

KEDA is a CNCF project and follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Recognizing community members with Credly badges

KEDA is only as successful as the community that drives it. To show our appreciation to essential members of our community, we want to recognize them by issuing Credly badges.

We are supporting the following badges:

| Type | Description | Level | Notes |
|:-----|:------------|:------|:------|
| Maintainer | Defines a clear vision of the project to grow the project and help the cloud-native community to scale Kubernetes workloads efficiently.  | Advanced | Only issued to [KEDA Maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md)|
| Scaler Maintainer | Maintain one or more built-in KEDA scaler. You don't commit and run, but help maintain the scaler! | Intermediate | |
| Contributor | Contribute to the KEDA community and help with maintainers to make KEDA a better project, be it with code contributions, reviews and/or documentation improvements. | Intermediate | |
| Documentarian |  This badge recognizes excellence in documentation contributions to CNCF and its projects. Excellent technical documentation is one of the best ways projects can lower the barrier to contribution. | Intermediate | |
| Chop Wood Carry Water | A distinguished badge for community contributors that focus on the non-shiny improvements of KEDA, such as test automation/coverage/stability, quality/performance improvements, security, etc. | Intermediate | |

If you believe you apply to the criteria for one of these badges, feel free to reach out to [cncf-keda-maintainers@](mailto:) and explain why you believe you qualify for a badge.
